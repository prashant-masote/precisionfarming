                        Khet Market is a web app through which farmers can sell crops and buy
                        equipment directly from other merchants without any third-party mediation.
                        To avoid price inflation and maintain regulated selling, the app validates
                        any purchase through the use of MSP for pricing. The app also incorporates
                        payment authentication, helping both parties avoid middleman costs and 
                        enabling a completely self-sufficient virtual market space.
